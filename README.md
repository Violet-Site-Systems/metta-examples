Discussion of MeTTa programming with examples

This repo is being used as part of a project by Violet Site Systems which will create a small app for OpenCog Hyperon in Atomspace using the MeTTa Language by @colleenpridemore and @MissCoventry

(The examples are potentially not maintainable, but still were interesting or had some importance at certain moments of time.)
